SOURCES

- Worked alongside a Computer Science student, David Sohn, who showed me how to identify a number in a String using (String).matches(".*\\d.*")
- Used geeksforgeeks.org for guidance using the LocalDate package
     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-time-localdate-class-in-java/
- stackoverflow.com was used to find a method to calculate the time elapsed between 2 dates
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27005861/calculate-days-between-two-dates-in-java-8
  
- ChatGPT was used to error check and make corrections within the createBooksToAdd() method inside of the Administrator.java class. 
  Roughly 60-70% of the code was originally made by us. 
  
- *I think we can delete this *ChatGPT was used to get the main method in the BookShop class to interact with non-static methods
     this was the prompt entered: "these lines 'saveUser(c);' and 'logout();' are being marked as errors in vs code in my main method, any idea why?"
  
- Did some research on Scanner objects to see how we could implement them more neatly
