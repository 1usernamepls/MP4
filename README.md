     https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-time-localdate-class-in-java/

- ChatGPT was used to get the main method in the BookShop class to interact with non-static methods
     this was the prompt entered: "these lines 'saveUser(c);' and 'logout();' are being marked as errors in vs code in my main method, any idea why?"
